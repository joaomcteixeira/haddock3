max_models:
  default: 10000
  type: integer
  min: 1
  max: 20000
  title: Maximum number of models to calculate RMSD matrix
  short: If the number of models exceeds max_models the execution is blocked
  long: If the number of models exceeds the few thousands, the calculation of
    the RMSD matrix is computationally demanding, especially in terms of CPU
    and disk space.

resdic_:
  default: []
  type: list
  minitems: 0
  maxitems: 100
  title: List of residues
  short: The residue numbers that should be used in the alignment and in the
    RMSD calculation.
  long: resdic_* is an expandable parameter. You can provide resdic_A,
    resdic_B, resdic_C, etc, where the last capital letter is the chain
    identifier.
