# Changelog

## new_version

* Updated the rigidbody sampling module by cleaning the CNS scripts and making them uptodate with the 2.4/2.5 version
* Created a new rigid-body example to test the updated implementation
* Added the model number to the generated CNS input scripts (used to define the random seed)
* Further cleaning of the modules, removed uncessary stuff
* Removed the iteration variable - not needed since each module has its own variables/default
* rigidbody now fully working without any errors at the CNS level
